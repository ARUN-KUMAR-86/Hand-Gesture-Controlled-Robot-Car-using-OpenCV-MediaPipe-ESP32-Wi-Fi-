# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Robot-Car-using-OpenCV-MediaPipe-ESP32-Wi-Fi-
A vision-based robot car control system using OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture recognition. Finger-count gestures are mapped to movement commands and transmitted wirelessly via UDP to an ESP32, which drives the motors accordingly, enabling intuitive, contactless control over Wi-Fi.
